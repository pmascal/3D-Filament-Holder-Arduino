### Main screen options
#### Main display
#### Set spool
#### Projects
#### Select Units
 
 
### Main Display
The display that shows the current mass/volume/percent left of whatever is currently on the spool holder
 
### Set spool
#### New spool
If the spool is not already saved, place the spool on the holder and enter the mass of FILAMENT on the spool. Ideally this will be done with a brand new spool. This process calculates the mass of the spool container and subtracts it from the mass/volume/percentage that is displayed on the Main Display. This option needs to be 4 characters so if the mass of the filament is less than 1000 grams, input zeros in front.

The system will ask if you would like to save this spool to the system. If you select yes, you will be asked which spool number you would like to name it: 1, 2, or 3.

#### Saved spool
This option allows you to set the current spool to one you have already saved in the system. It also displays the user the current estimated amount of mass of filament on the spool.
 
### Projects
#### Start project
Select this option while there is a spool currently set, and before the filament is connected to the 3D printer. Then start your project.
 
#### End project
Select this option when the 3D printer has finished with your project, ideally with the filament disconnected from the 3D printer.
 
#### Past prints
The “Start project” and “End project” results will be seen here. User will be prompted to select which spool’s past print sizes they would like to see. Once a spool is selected, the past 4 prints that were done on that spool will be displayed. Units are in grams, and “1” is the most recent project.
 
### Select Units
User will be prompted with a list of options to view the amount of filament remaining on their spool while in the main display option. They can choose mass (g), volume (cm^3), or percentage (%).
