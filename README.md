# 3D-Filament-Holder-Arduino

The code I generated for this project enables an arduino to be attached to my custom made spool holder, measuring/recording mass of filament left in the spool with a load cell, record time for projects, as well as directing a menu system for an LCD display. A user can maneuver through the display with an IR remote.

In addition to recording mass (g), it can be converted to percentage of filament left in the spool (assuming a standard 1000 gram spool is used) or volume (cm^3). The information for the past 4 projects of 3 different spools can be saved. This information includes the mass of filament used and time it took for the project to finish.

Check out the `user_manual.md` to see a more detailed description of each option.
